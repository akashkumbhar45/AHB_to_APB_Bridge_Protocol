Project Overview
This project focuses on the functional verification of the AHB to APB bridge protocol, a commonly used bridge in AMBA-based SoC architectures. The purpose of this verification environment is to ensure the correctness, reliability, and completeness of the protocol conversion logic between the Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) and the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB).
